# Waste Classification Model

## Problem Statement

The Waste Classification Model is designed to accurately classify different types of waste based on input images. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for waste management, enabling automated waste classification and facilitating proper disposal and recycling.

The primary motivation behind this dataset is to address the importance of garbage recycling in preserving our environment. Sorting garbage into groups with similar recycling processes is crucial for effective recycling. Existing datasets typically classify garbage into a limited number of classes, usually ranging from 2 to 6. By expanding the number of classes for household garbage classification, we can significantly increase the recycling rate.

To collect the data, an ideal setup would involve placing a camera above a conveyor belt where garbage items pass one by one, allowing the camera to capture real garbage images. However, such a setup is currently not feasible. As a result, most of the images in this dataset were collected through web scraping. Whenever possible, efforts were made to gather images closely related to garbage items. For example, for the biological waste category, images of rotten vegetables, fruits, and food remains were searched for. However, obtaining images specifically depicting clothes or shoes from the garbage proved to be more challenging. Therefore, the dataset primarily contains images of regular clothes. Nonetheless, the ability to classify these images into 12 different classes represents a significant step towards improving the recycling process.

By utilizing this dataset, we aim to develop a waste classification model that can accurately categorize household garbage, thereby contributing to the advancement of recycling practices.



## Exploratory Analysys

### 1. Photo dataset
The model was trained using a comprehensive dataset of waste images. The dataset contains labeled images representing various waste categories such as batteries, biological waste, cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. The dataset was collected from diverse sources and manually annotated to ensure high-quality training data.



### 2. Recycling situation




## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of 15,150 images representing 12 different classes of household garbage. These classes include paper, cardboard, biological waste, metal, plastic, green glass, brown glass, white glass, clothes, shoes, batteries, and trash.

The SuperStore dataset used for this project should be accessible via the Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification?datasetId=1115942&sortBy=voteCount
